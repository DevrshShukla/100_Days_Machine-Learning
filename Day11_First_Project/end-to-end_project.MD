# End-to-End Toy Project | Day 13 | 100 Days of Machine Learning

Welcome to the Day 13 project — an **End-to-End Machine Learning Toy Project** designed to show you how to take a dataset and build a complete ML workflow from start to finish.

This project uses **simple machine learning principles** to help you understand how real ML systems work in practice.
