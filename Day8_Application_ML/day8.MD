# 📘 Day 8: Applications of Machine Learning

This document explains the **real-world applications of Machine Learning (ML)** discussed in Day 8, with simple explanations and examples.

## 🏦 1. Banking & Finance

ML is widely used in banks to improve security and customer experience.

### 🔹 Applications:
- **Fraud Detection** – Detect suspicious transactions.
- **Loan Approval** – Decide whether to approve a loan based on user history.
- **Credit Scoring** – Predict if a customer can repay a loan.

### 🧠 How it works:
The model learns from **previous customer data** (income, spending, repayment history).

### 🌍 Real-World Example:
If a person suddenly uses their card in another country, ML can flag it as possible fraud and block the card.

## 🛡️ 2. Insurance

ML helps insurance companies decide **policy price (premium)** and manage risks.

### 🔹 Applications:
- Premium prediction
- Claim fraud detection
- Risk analysis

### 🧠 How it works:
If risk is high → premium increases.  
If risk is low → premium is normal.

### 🌍 Real-World Example:
A person living in a flood-prone area may get a higher insurance premium because chances of damage are higher.

## 🛒 3. Retail / E-Commerce  
(Example: Amazon, Flipkart)

ML helps companies understand **what to sell, how much to stock, and what to recommend**.

### 🔹 Key Idea:
Use **previous sales data** to predict future demand.

**Sales → Previous Sales Data → Which product to increase → Increase quantity**


### ❗ Important:
We should **not increase stock of all products**, because:
- It increases cost
- Not all products will sell

ML helps choose only the **right products**.

### 🌍 Real-World Example:
If mobile phones sell more during festivals, ML predicts this and increases only mobile stock, not everything.

## 📦 Inventory & Demand Forecasting

ML helps decide:
- Which product will sell more
- How much quantity to keep in the warehouse

### 🌍 Example:
A grocery store stocks more cold drinks in summer based on past sales.

---

## 🤝 Product Correlation (Recommendation)

ML finds the **relationship between two products**.

### 🔹 Process:
- Find correlation between products
- If correlation is high → place them together or recommend

### 🌍 Real-World Example:
If people who buy **bread** also buy **butter**, the system:
- Places them together in store
- Or shows: *“Customers also bought butter”*

This is how recommendation systems work.
