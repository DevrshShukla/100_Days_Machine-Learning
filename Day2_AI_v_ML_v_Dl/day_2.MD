## 🤖 What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to the broad field of building machines and systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.

Examples include:
- Voice assistants
- Self-driving cars
- Chatbots

✨ AI is an **umbrella term** that includes all techniques enabling machines to mimic human cognitive abilities. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 📊 What Is Machine Learning (ML)?

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a **subset of AI** that focuses on giving computers the ability to **learn from data** instead of being explicitly programmed.

Key points:
- Learns patterns from data
- Improves performance over time
- Used for prediction and classification

⟶ ML is a *way to implement AI* using data-driven learning algorithms. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🧠 What Is Deep Learning (DL)?

**Deep Learning (DL)** is a **subfield of Machine Learning** that uses **artificial neural networks** with many layers (deep architectures) to model complex patterns in large datasets.

Important ideas:
- Inspired by the human brain
- Excellent for image, audio, and text processing
- Requires large data and compute

DL can automatically extract high-level features without manual engineering. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
