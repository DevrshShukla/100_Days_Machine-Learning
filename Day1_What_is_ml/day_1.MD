## 📌 Introduction

This video is the first step in the **100 Days of Machine Learning** journey.  
It explains **what Machine Learning is**, why it exists, and how it is different from traditional programming.

The goal of this session is to build **strong conceptual clarity** before diving into algorithms and code.

## 🤖 What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that enables systems to learn patterns from data and improve automatically through experience, without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

> “Machine learning gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.”

Instead of writing rules manually, we let the machine **discover rules from data**.


## 📊 Types of Machine Learning (Overview)

> These are introduced conceptually and will be covered in detail later in the series.

### 1. Supervised Learning
- Data is labeled
- Example: Email spam detection

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Data is unlabeled
- Example: Customer segmentation

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- Learning through rewards and penalties
- Example: Game-playing AI

## ⚙️ How Machine Learning Works (High Level)

1. **Data Collection**
2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
3. **Model Selection**
4. **Training the Model**
5. **Evaluation**
6. **Prediction on New Data**

The model learns patterns during training and applies them to unseen data.
